awesome-config
==============

It's my config file for awesome windows manager.

## Installation

1. Make sure ~/.config/awesome exist, otherwise you need to create it by type the following command.
    mkdir -p ~/.config/awesome

2. Clone repository to ~/.config/awesome.
    git clone https://github.com/emrys-fan/awesome-config.git ~/.config/awesome

3. That's all. 

## Use
For keybinding detail you should check the awesome man page.
I modified three most commonly used keybindings to make it more convienient.

1. Kill focused client(Close focus window):
        mod4 + c
2. View next tag:
        mod4 + .
3. View preview tag:
        mod4 + ,

mod4 + e for revelation.
